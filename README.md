Developing a Basic Calculator Application

The task involved designing and developing a simple calculator application using Python programming language. The primary objective was to create a user-friendly tool capable of performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application was developed in a modular manner, focusing on simplicity, functionality, and error handling to ensure a seamless user experience.

Step 1: Planning and Designing the Calculator

The initial step was to conceptualize the features and flow of the application. Since it was a simple calculator, the focus was on four key operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

Step 2: Writing the Core Functionality

The development began by implementing the core functionality using Python functions. Each arithmetic operation was defined as a separate function for modularity and reusability. 

Step 3: Creating the User Interface

The program used a text-based menu-driven interface. This interface prompts the user to choose an operation from a list (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, etc.). After the user selects an option, they are prompted to input two numbers.

Step 4: Testing and Debugging

Testing was an integral part of the task to ensure that the calculator operated correctly under various scenarios.

Step 5: Finalizing and Documenting

After successful testing and debugging, the application was finalized. Comments were added to the code to enhance readability and maintainability.
